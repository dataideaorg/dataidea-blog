## The Evolution of AI in Cinema

These ten films showcase how AI themes evolved across different decades and genres. From the Cold War paranoia of Colossus and WarGames to the body-horror implications of Upgrade, each movie reflects contemporary anxieties about technology and control.

**The 1970s-80s** worried about AI controlling weapons and nuclear arsenals, unable to understand human nuance.

**The 2000s** explored AI in action and horror contexts, from apocalyptic viruses to digital worlds.

**The 2010s** focused on consciousness, identity, and the blurring lines between human and machine.

Together with Part 1, these twenty films form a comprehensive exploration of cinema's relationship with artificial intelligence—essential viewing for anyone interested in how we imagine our technological future.
